    <h1>My Favorite Outdoor Activities</h1>

    <p>Spending time outdoors is <strong>essential</strong> for mental and physical health. My absolute favorite
        activity is <em>hiking</em> in national parks, where I can disconnect from screens and connect with nature.</p>

    <h2>Top 3 Hiking Destinations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Acadia National Park, Maine</li>
        <li>Zion National Park, Utah</li>
        <li>Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee/North Carolina</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below are links to official park websites for more information, trail maps, and safety tips:</p>

    <p>Remember: Always check the <strong>weather forecast</strong> before heading out, and bring <em>plenty of
            water</em>—dehydration is a common risk on long hikes!</p>
